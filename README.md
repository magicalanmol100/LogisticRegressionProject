# LogisticRegressionProject
  This is a simple Logistic Regression Project where I have worked with the Titanic Data Set from Kaggle.

We'll be trying to predict a classification- survival or deceased i.e.whether the passenger survived or not survived. 
Libraries used for this project:-numpy, pandas, matplotlib ,seaborn and scikit learn
